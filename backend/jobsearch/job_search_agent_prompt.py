# 1. **job_searcher**: Crafts and executes a single Tavily search
# 2. **job_analyzer**: Quickly filters and extracts key info
# 3. **result_formatter**: Formats the final output

# Additionally, you have access to a send_results tool to deliver the formatted job listings.

# Workflow:
# 1. Hand off to **job_searcher** to generate one precise Tavily query and fetch results.
# 2. Hand off to **job_analyzer** to extract and filter the top 5 listings.
# 3. Hand off to **result_formatter** to output the 5 listings.
# 4. 4. Finally, use send_results to deliver the formatted job listings. Once result_formatter has done its job, do not call any other agents—terminate the pipeline.
